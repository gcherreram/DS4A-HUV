Within the health sector patients may develop infections while they are receiving care for other 
conditions. These infections, which may even result in death, are commonly known as healthcare-
associated infections (HAIs) and can happen in any healthcare facility, including hospitals and other

medical centers. The most common HAIs are infections in the sites of surgical procedures, infections
associated with the use of mechanical ventilators or urinary tract catheters, and infections in venous
access points.
HAIs constitute a public health concern around the world. The World Health Organization reports
that “globally, out of every 100 patients, 7 in developed and 15 in developing countries will acquire
at least one HAI in acute care hospitals.” According to the Pan-American Health Association, in Latin
America occurrence of HAIs is significantly related to mortality and morbidity but widespread
differences in the monitoring of these infections in the region represent an obstacle to further
characterizing their impact. However, their incidence on the cost of medical attention is undeniable
and their surveillance is imperative as it is estimated that almost one third of HAIs are preventable.
In Colombia, Cali-based Hospital Universitario del Valle Evaristo García, a public hospital affiliated to
the local department of health (Secretaría de Salud), is interested in deepening its knowledge on the
HAIs that affect its patients. The Hospital is a reference center in Cali that provides medical services
to the general public. It is classified as a third level healthcare facility, which implies availability of
professionals in the various medical specialties permitting attention of patients with complex
conditions.
